        <li> Annie Jean Easley (1933 - 2011) was an American computer scientist, 
            mathematician, and rocket scientist.</li>
        <li> She was one of the first African-Americans to work at NASA.</li>
        <li> Annie was a leading member of the team which developed software for

          Annie Easley had never heard of the National Advisory Committee for 
            Aeronautics (NACA) when she read an article about twin sisters who were 
            “human computers” at the Aircraft Engine Research Laboratory in Cleveland, 
            Ohio. The Lab (the predecessor of the NASA Glenn Research Center) was in need 
            of people with strong math skills, and she was in need of a job after recently 
            relocating from Birmingham, Alabama. Two weeks after reading the article, 
            Easley began a career that would span 34 years. She would contribute to 
            numerous programs as a computer scientist, inspire many through her 
            enthusiastic participation in outreach programs, break down barriers for women 
            and people of color in science, technology, engineering, and mathematic (STEM) 
            fields, and win the admiration and respect of her coworkers.<br>
            <br>
            In 1955, Easley began her career as a “human computer,” doing computations 
            for researchers. This involved analyzing problems and doing calculations by 
            hand. When hired, she was one of only four African-American employees at the 
            Lab. When human computers were replaced by machines, Easley evolved along 
            with the technology. She became an adept computer programmer, using 
            languages like the Formula Translating System (Fortran) and the Simple Object 
            Access Protocol (SOAP) to support a number of NASA's programs. She developed 
            and implemented code used in researching energy-conversion systems, 
            analyzing alternative power technology—including the battery technology that 
            was used for early hybrid vehicles, as well as for the Centaur upper-stage 
            rocket.<br>
                    <br>
                    Easley was very dedicated in her outreach efforts at NASA. She not only 
            participated in school tutoring programs but was a very active participant in the 
            speaker's bureau—telling students about NASA's work and inspiring especially 
            female and minority students to consider STEM careers. Later in her career, she 
            took on the additional role of equal employment opportunity (EEO) counselor. 
            Easley retired in 1989, but she remained an active participant in the Speaker's 
            Bureau and the Business & Professional Women's association. Annie Easley 
            passed away on June 25, 2011. <a href='https://www.nasa.gov/feature/annie-easley-computer-scientist' target="_blank"
